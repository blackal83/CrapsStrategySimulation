# CrapsStrategySimulation
 
This is a program to try out different craps strategies over a long set of dice rolls to see what works best over the long run.  RNG is not as good as rolling the dice, but best we have.

Many thanks to DelightfulKissboy for his GamblingAnalysis app at https://github.com/DelightfulKissboy/GamblingAnalysis.  I used that as a basis to build mine, though much of it has been removed (any non-craps) and changed from how he went about it, as I want to get more detailed with the shooters/rolls/etc
